This repository contains my Tech Basics II exam project code.

Have you ever wanted to go to a concert but had nobody to go with you? Then here is the solution â€“ the ConcertBuddy app. With this app, you can meet new people, who will attend the same concert as you and share mutual interests with you. 

The helpers.py python script in the help folder contains two definitions you need to run my app code - clearing the widgets and placing a background image.

## Instructions to run my app:

1. Clone my repository

https://github.com/anissabln/anissa-blonn-tbii-exam.git

3. Download the pictures folder with the necessary images

4. Change the directory
   
cd anissa-blonn-tbii-exam

6. Run the code
   
Mac:
python3 app.py

Windows:
